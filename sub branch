This web application is designed to help gardeners, farmers, and plant enthusiasts easily identify different types of soil and receive tailored plant recommendations based on the selected soil type. By understanding the characteristics and suitability of various soils—such as loamy, sandy, clayey, silty, peaty, and chalky—users can make informed decisions about which plants are most likely to thrive in their garden or farm. Additionally, the application highlights whether the soil is naturally suitable for planting or if amendments are needed to improve its quality, promoting better crop growth and more successful gardening outcomes.
